# Example Idris2 Environment

To get started (optionally) follow the instructions on https://app.cachix.org/cache/shmish111 to add the nix cache then run `nix-shell`. 

You can now run `idris2 -p wl-pprint` and have access to the wl-pprint and lens libraries. 

Take a look at [shell.nix](./shell.nix) to see how to add other idris2 libraries from smoke hill.
